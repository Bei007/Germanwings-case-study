       "'\"they have been unresponsive\"\\nBrian McNamee (Canada) 16th October 2015\\n2\\nWe flew with Germanwings (or tried to) on September 30th. After two lengthy delays passengers were notified that the flight was cancelled and to return to the check-in counter for further information. After waiting at the counter for another 30 minutes or so, staff began issuing refunds or providing alternate travel options to passengers. By this point it was quite late in the evening with limited options (plus we were 5+ hours after planned departure). We managed to get a voucher with 3 other passenger to get a flight from Stuttgart to Zurich with an ongoing connection to Amsterdam (flights were with Swiss). We made the flight and the connector (which was held back waiting for about 70 of us) however luggage did not make it. Short of this is the airline was ill-prepared to manage this. They offered little information or options to passengers. since returning home I have been attempting to contact them via email and phone calls to discuss compensation per passenger rights brochure and they have been unresponsive.

I find this disgusting, the fact that a passenger will not be offered water if they\\'re unwell, and will not be looked after in any way.

Told by the cabin crew that many planes were delayed due to technical problems that day so we would definitely catch our transit flight to London. Arrived Dusseldorf, no information given, transit closed. Eventually told to go to Lufthansa ticket desk where we joined a long queue for about 2 hours. Eventually told \"no flights tonight, maybe one on Monday\" (2days later). Lufthansa and Germanwings staff didn\\'t seem to know who was doing what. Came back to ticket desk at 5am next morning and given overbooked standby ticket for 4 hours later. We made a fuss and insisted on getting a seat (otherwise we would have taken the train). We were given a seat but suspect that others were \"bumped down\" by Germanwings who were prioritising based on who made the biggest noise. Bad karma probably meant our flight took off but had to turn back to Dusseldorf due to more technical problems so we went round the same circle again - delay, no communication. This time we ran across the airport to the now familiar ticket desk where we were given tickets to London via Munich. Arrived home 39 hours after we left Istanbul, vowing never to book Germanwings again. Flight out with Turkish Airlines was a dream, should have booked return trip.

Strangely, only the Germanwings flight to Berlin was affected, Air Berlin left on time. Delays can happen, but the complete lack of information and assistance was not acceptable. No ground staff was available, phone calls to Germanwings were not answered. No meal voucher was offered. To add insult to injury, access to Star Alliance lounges is denied to Gold members outside Germany when you travel with Germanwings because they are a Lufthansa subsidiary but not a member of Star Alliance. The flight itself was smooth, but no inflight entertainment whatsoever. For the same price, Air Berlin offers much better value.

This was a surprise since it was below Germanwings allowable size. The enforcer instructed the ticket agent to weigh my carry-on. Unfortunately, it did exceed the 8kg weight limit. My only option was to remove excess weight, which I did. I removed clothing and gifts until I reached the 8 kg limit and placed them in the garbage pail provided by the ticket agent. I believe in following rules, but they need to be clearly indicated and consistently applied. This experience was in itself unpleasant. We checked in an extra piece of luggage and had to go to another agent to pay a 75 euro surcharge. However, we were informed that the surcharge would be 150 Euros for 2 pieces of luggage. The 2 agents communicated by phone and eventually discovered that we had erroneously been charged for an extra suitcase.\\nType Of Traveller\\tCouple Leis ure\\nCabin Flown\\tEconomy\\nRoute\\tHamburg to Geneva\\nDate Flown\\tJune 2015\\nSeat Comfort\\t12345\\nCabin Staff Service\\t12345\\nGround Service\\t12345\\nWifi & Connectivity\\t12345\\nValue For Money\\t12345\\nRecommended\\tno\\n\\nGermanwings customer review\\nB Diener (Czech Republic) 31st May 2015\\n7\\n4U7779 and 4U7778 May16 and May 26 PRG-HAM-PRG economy class.

Best is not business but it is a best Germanwings has to offer. You sit in row 1 to 3 and the middle seat is free so there is maximum of 12 travellers. You have access to LH lounge which is full in Hamburg Airport. There is a choice of finger food salat nuts and gummibears as well as hot and cold drinks beer wine and spirits. Boarding with priority. Was a little surprised by the food you get on board you can choose from the Germanwings card whatever you want for free if it is loaded. The best thing was the flight attendant who was nice and very friendly. She addressed everybody by name and was professional.

The replacement of Lufthansa services that do not connect via Frankfurt or Munich with Germanwings has in my view turned out as a major downgrade. Aircraft layout (different seat pitch in economy in one and the same aircraft) and classes (no business class offering but instead a section labelled \"best\") seem quite incoherent. Delays are frequent sometimes with subsequent cancellations without explanations from unwelcoming ground staff. Miles & More status is worth less than on LH (no fast lane no lounge). It is as close to a true low cost carrier as LH could get. Luckily there are some routes left where you get to choose (e.g. on HAM-ZRH Swiss operates some proper flights).\\nCabin Flown\\tEconomy\\nSeat Comfort\\t12345\\nCabin Staff Service\\t12345\\nFood & Beverages\\t12345\\nInflight Entertainment\\t12345\\nValue For Money\\t12345\\nRecommended\\tno\\n\\nGermanwings customer review\\nH Mutschler (Germany) 1st May 2015\\n4\\nCGN to HAM Airbus 320.

Staff on both flights were efficient rather than friendly which they probably needed to be on such a short flight. The smart fare also included a a drink and a snack and to be honest I wish they hadn\\'t bothered because it was quite definitely the worst inflight meal I have had in over 40 years of flying. The \"snack\" consisted of a sandwich of turkey in soggy brown bread which was totally inedible a small bottle of water and a tiny Toblerone chocolate. I also made the mistake of having tea which was tepid dishwater. My tip would be to avoid the sandwich and have juice to drink.

Was regular user of LH flights since they put GW in place I do everything I can to avoid this airline. No value for money and cost are usually higher than alternative carriers. Other carriers offer way better service and value for money. I specifically dislike the fact that on the majority of the flights I have been using seats were broken (once you lean back they recline) and airplane interior was poor condition / not cleaned. On my last trip I advised the steward on board on a chewing gum sticking to the emergency exit seat and asked him to ensure it is being removed on the next cleaning cycle. The answer was that he was not cleaning the airplane. Think that shows the service mindset.

Both legs of the journey were late. On both occasions we were called to the gate on time and then waited and waited. At least at Cologne Bonn there are seats and toilets at the gates in Manchester we were left standing for over an hour. No information from the airline and no apology - very poor show. Sadly this lack of customer service is my experience with Lufthansa short haul generally (GW are part of Lufthansa) which is why I avoid them for short haul flights these days. On short flights my priority is punctuality and here they are sadly lacking.

Had checked in online and printed my boarding card 2 days before but as I had a suitcase to go in the hold I still needed to queue at the baggage drop-off point/check in desk. Flight left on time and was smooth throughout. The plane seemed new and was clean. My fare included a snack (choice of cheese or ham roll) a small packet with 3 boiled sweets (not quite sure why) and a small bottle of water. I chose the cheese sandwich which was \"ok but could be better\". After the complimentary snack service the crew came round offering hot and cold drinks - including alcoholic drinks - although not sure if any of these were complimentary. We landed 1 hour after departure from Heathrow slightly less time than advertised. I have scored the in-flight entertainment a 1 purely because being a short flight there wasn\\'t any and the website won\\'t allow me to submit my review without a score. Based on my experience I would consider flying with German Wings again.\\nCabin Flown\\tEconomy\\nSeat Comfort\\t12345\\nCabin Staff Service\\t12345\\nFood & Beverages\\t12345\\nInflight Entertainment\\t12345\\nValue For Money\\t12345\\nRecommended\\tyes\\n\\nGermanwings customer review\\nA Firth (United Kingdom) 9th September 2014\\nna\\nI am writing this on behalf of my wife who is currently flying the wrong way across Europe due to the incompetence of this shambolic operation. She was booked to fly from Hanover to London Stansted. There was a short delay and the passengers got on. The passengers were then told to get off as astonishingly the crew needed to finish their shift. They were left waiting for three hours without any information. When they re-boarded the flight they were told they would be flying to Cologne instead of London to pick up more passengers. A bit like one of those cheap taxi buses I guess. Hopefully she\\'ll make it home before I have to go to work tomorrow.

This segment was part of a larger Lufthansa itinerary though clearly advertised as a 4U flight. The catch here is that Germanwings out of Hamburg is actually operated by Eurowings CRJ900s which is an absolute letdown compared to the usual A320s. The staff are enthusiastic about offering refreshments though - unlike Lufthansa proper - these are strictly for sale and are perhaps pushed too hard.

On such \"longer flights\" of more than two hours they should offer a pasta or a similar hot dish as their parent company does on similar routes.

On three occasions now I have taken Germanwings return flights to Brussels. On every occasion the flight has been cancelled on the return journey to Stuttgart. This is because they do not have a full flight (around 50-100 passengers max) and therefore they make an excuse about a technical problem and shift passengers to the next scheduled flight which is also not full in order to send one flight to Stuttgart full of passengers but over three hours delayed. They are being greedy and looking after their profits and with no care for the passengers who need to get to their destinations or connecting flights.

Evening service after Cologne Carnival parade. Lots of passengers and even captain disguised accordingly. Boarding delayed due to late arrival from previous flight but crew managed to catch up: departure on time arrival 10 min early. Crew quite neutral whereas Captain made funny announcements in view of the carnival. Seat comfort is okay for such a short hop. Only buy-on-board program with relatively high pricing compared to quantity of products - so I opted for nothing. Germanwings is low cost and you practically pay for everything you want extra besides the seat. Germanwings has taken over complete service from Lufthansa on that particular route. Being Star Alliance Silver/FTL at Lufthansa means nothing if you fly on Germanwings (a 100% Lufthansa subsidiary). Some weeks ago in 2012 when LH still served the sector FTLs were allowed to use the LH business lounge.

The minor took the seat next to me. Once we had achieved cruising altitude the mother produced an iPad from her bag and placed it on the table in front of the child. Then without the slightest consideration for their fellow passengers a Mickey Mouse movie was run with the soundtrack coming to all in earshot over the speakers. Since it was a reasonably short flight I plugged my own headphones in a did my best to ignore the cartoon. Now that such technology is available I think it might be high time for Germanwings to regulate such behavior. Obviously a sense of social responsibility is no longer sufficient.

Check-in at PRG okay. Onboard you have to pay for food or beverages (2-3 EUR for one piece) but for this short trip (55 ins)I think it is not necessary. Nice clean cabin the problem is poor leg-room but for a short flight it is possible to survive. A319 on both ways almost full. The return flight was not so easy - at the moment we were boarding they told us to stop because of a technical problem and passengers had to move back out of the bus up to the terminal building where we had to wait next 3 hours till the problem was sorted out - after 1 hour of the waiting time they provided vouchers for refreshment (5 EUR to spend in kiosks around the terminal). Generally it was well organised. I was fortunately flexible and not in hurry to arrive at Prague on time. We were delayed for more than 3 hours with our departure.\\nCabin Flown\\tEconomy\\nValue For Money\\t12345\\nRecommended\\tyes\\n\\nGermanwings customer review\\nM Abraham (United Kingdom) 28th March 2010\\nna\\nTravel with Caution. If you need to complain about their service the call charge is 25 pence per minute. I purchased a higher priced ticket for London to Stuttgart which included for one luggage both ways an on-board snacks. In London they accepted my luggage without any additional charge but had to pay for all food and drinks. On return from Stuttgart I had to pay for my luggage and snacks. It is realistic to complain because it would cost 25 pence per minute.

The first time they canceled the flight with reference to weather - however when I checked the website of the arrival airport everyone else was flying save for Germanwings. They merely referred to the decision of their company. We had to return back to Strasbourg and wait for two days for the next flight on which they were able to assign us. I had a small baby with me and the new flight they offered was not even a direct flight. On the second occasion the flight was delayed for more than three hours. However until the very last moment the passengers were lied to about the delay. Any attempts to obtain information and to be provided with vouchers for food were left without response. The call center in Germany tried to hide information about the delay saying that the flight was delayed for less than two hours. While the website of the airport already showed that the delay was over three hours. The company\\'s representative was nowhere to be found in the airport. The Germanwings call center gave numbers of the airport service which in its turn gave numbers of the Germandwings.\\nCabin Flown\\tEconomy\\nValue For Money\\t12345\\nRecommended\\tno\\n\\nGermanwings customer review\\nM Brown (United Kingdom) 9th February 2010\\nna\\nFound the customer service centre staff awful. They failed to mention that there is an EUR 80 fee when using the call centre. When I called back to query this I was told to \\'take it or leave it\\' and hung up on. When I complained they denied everything and closed the complaint. To date I have not heard from them again. From previous experience the airline itself is great but the customer service and general attitude is more than bad it is insulting. Germanwings problem is not what it does but how it handles the ensuing complaints.

Despite the sudden snowfall at their Cologne hub Germanwings managed to keep their operations moving reasonably efficiently. Waiting PAX were kept informed and when the delayed aircraft came in from Leipzig it was turned around in less than 15 minutes. The aircraft seemed almost new and was less than half full. Service pleasant of the low cost variety and snacks and drinks cost no more than they would in a Cologne cafï¿½.

Called the airline (GBP0.25 per minute) was told I could not cancel but only postpone and that I needed to provide a new date (c EUR25 per route per person). I decided to call back with the dates but also noticed a further EUR80 charge. Called a second time queried this with operator and was told \\'take it or leave it\\'. I informed the operator this was unacceptable language and was cut off! Called a third time asked for the manager put on hold then spoke with the manager. Was told the charge applied to call centre fees and did not apply to online changes. As I could not get online I asked the manger to make the changes without the charge which they did. I asked for the second call to be investigated which they have not done.

Friendly efficient (and thus precisely punctual). GW allowed us to pool our 20kg/person checked-baggage limit across the five passengers on the reservation so we didn\\'t have to scramble to get one of the bags down from 22 to 20 kg. I also like that you can pay ï¿½20 in advance for a bag up to 30kg rather than get burned at the airport like Ryanair. Seat pitch a bit cramped but that\\'s standard for budget flights; it wasn\\'t a long flight so I wasn\\'t uncomfortable. Didn\\'t seem possible fully to match the better bargains on Easyjet or Aer Lingus but price was still very good.

It is not possible to book a bonus ticket. As soon as one tries to get into the bonus account the answer from the system comes with a long delay. The longer the more advanced one is in the actual booking. At the end one always gets a FEHLER on the page. I have tried plenty of times at different occasions from different computers running different OS and browsers. Always the same effect. The support phone number is also dead as expected even if they warn about .99Euro per minute.\\nRecommended\\tno\\n\\nGermanwings customer review\\nP Gatineau 13th October 2008\\n3\\nSTR-LIS-STR. One of the longest Germanwings route from Stuttgart. To my surprise the seat pitch was good. I wonder whether Germanwings uses special aircraft (the old one) with less seats on these long routes. Outbound delayed by one hour. Return on time but had to wait 45 minutes for the bags. Polite crew and nice flight. Had reserved 9 months in advance so flight fare was acceptable but still far away from the discount prices advertised everywhere.

Looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with this favourite budget carrier after a gap of 3-4 years my spirits sank on arrival at Stansted as a throng of passengers for both this and the similarly-timed Stuttgart flight were milling around the check-in desk. Only one person was dealing with the two flights. This was down to the Swissport agency. A manageress from the latter belatedly assessed the unsatisfactory situation and a second check-in agent duly arrived but it was a close-run thing for many passengers and we were 20 minutes late pushing back. Once on board the experience was good and I can again recommend the Happy Snack Plus offering which is good value and quality at EUR6.50. Return flight was fine albeit 40 minues late - excellent self-check-in arrangement at CGN.\\nRecommended\\tno\\n\\nGermanwings customer review\\nSam Holloway 18th August 2008\\n4\\nSTN-CGN-STN first time with Germanwings. Some confusion when booking as the website kept reverting into German and it wasn\\'t later possible to verify my booking online (so I phoned and everything was quickly confirmed). Outward was no problem at all. Allocated seating stops the stupid free-for- all crush and instantly makes the whole thing better than Ryanair. Coming back we arrived quite early and were told that the plane had been substituted for a smaller aircraft hence they were looking for people to bump onto the Lufthansa LHR flight. That\\'d probably be better for some people but we specifically needed to get back to STN. Fortunately they got enough people to change and we got checked through OK. However no-one told most passengers that their seat reservations were no longer valid (it was a completely different seat layout!) and so there was some frustration on boarding. But overall the service was good and the flights were on-time. We\\'ll give them another try.\\nRecommended\\tno\\n\\nGermanwings customer review\\nJ Nandris 18th June 2008\\n3\\nThe last-minute addition of ï¿½13 for use of a \"credit card\" [it was a debit card] and some other fee with no prior notice at the very last stage of the booking procedure verges on sharp practice by German Wings.

My second time on GermanWings. The first was marred by late departure caused by a public service strike in Germany - so not really their fault. However trip back this second time was diabolical. Flight cancelled. No explanation. Lousy ground staff at Cologne. Bussed to Dusseldorf with 60 other passengers for Air Berlin. Arrived too late - no GermanWings staff around; Air Berlin refused to take responsibility. Passengers getting very angry; police starting to take an interest. To get home I had to buy a single on KLM via Amsterdam at a cost of 330 euros.

By this point it was quite late in the evening with limited options (plus we were 5+ hours after planned departure). We managed to get a voucher with 3 other passenger to get a flight from Stuttgart to Zurich with an ongoing connection to Amsterdam (flights were with Swiss).
